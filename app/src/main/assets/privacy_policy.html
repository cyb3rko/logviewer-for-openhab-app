<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
    I built the LogViewer for openHAB app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.<br/><br/>

    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to
    use this Service.<br/><br/>

    If you choose to use this Service and if you explicitly allow the data collection, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
    relation to this policy.<br/>
    The Personal Information that I collect is used for improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone
    except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>

    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.
</p>
<h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
<p>
    For a better experience, while using my Service, I ask you to allow third party services to provide me with certain
    information, including but not limited to number of sessions, session duration, operating system, device model, geography, first launch,
    app opens and app updates. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.<br/><br/>

    The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you, provided that you allow data collection.<br/>

</ul>
<h5>Log Data</h5>
<p>
    I want to inform you that, provided that you allow data collection, whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data
    and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet
    Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>
    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
    websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.<br/>
    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
    information and improve their services.
</p>
<h5>Service Providers</h5>
<p>
    I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;To perform Service-related services;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
</p>
<h5>Security</h5>
<p>
    I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am striving to protect those data. But remember that no method of
    transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<p>
    This Service may contain links to websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that not every of these
    external sites are operated by me.<br/>

    assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
