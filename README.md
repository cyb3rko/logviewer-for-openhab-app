# LogViewer for openHAB-App

This is a simple and easy to use android app to simplify the mobile access to the log of an openHAB instance (running frontail) on your tablet or your smartphone.

I have not that much experience with programming so please help this project (if you want to) by reporting issues and requesting new features you would like to have and use.  
Furthermore I'm still a student so the progress might not be as fast as on other projects.

If you want to, you can also have a look at my other projects:
