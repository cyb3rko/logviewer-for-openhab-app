## About this project
This is a simple and easy to use android app to simplify the mobile access to the log of an [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) instance (running [frontail](https://github.com/mthenw/frontail)) on your tablet or your smartphone.

I have not that much experience with programming so please help this project by opening [issues](https://github.com/nikothegreek/logviewer-for-openhab-app/issues) and creating new [pull requests](https://github.com/nikothegreek/logviewer-for-openhab-app/pulls) for improving code and implementing new features (see chapter [Contribute](#contribute) for the guidelines).  
Furthermore I'm still a student so the progress might not be as fast as on other projects.

If you want to, you can also have a look at my other projects:

 - adjusting the text size of the log
 - saving the entered connection details and reconnecting to the last entered connection on next app start
 - switchable View Lock function to automatically scroll to the newest log entry and lock touch input
