## About this project
This is a simple and easy to use android app to simplify the mobile access to the log of an [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) instance (running [frontail](https://github.com/mthenw/frontail)) on your tablet or your smartphone.

I have not that much experience with programming so please help this project by opening [issues](https://github.com/cyb3rko/logviewer-for-openhab-app/issues) and creating new [pull requests](https://github.com/cyb3rko/logviewer-for-openhab-app/pulls) for improving code and implementing new features (see chapter [Contribute](#contribute)).  
Furthermore I'm still a student so the progress might not be as fast as on other projects.
