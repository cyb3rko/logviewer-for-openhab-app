    // Terms of Use
    <string name="terms_of_use1"><u>Terms of Use</u></string>
    <string name="terms_of_use2">
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You\'re not allowed to copy,
        or modify the app, any part of the app. You\'re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app or make derivative versions.
        \nThe app itself, and all the database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to me.
        \n\nI am committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services,
        at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you\'re paying for.
        \n\nThe LogViewer for openHAB app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It\'s your responsibility to keep your phone and access
        to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
        operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone\'s security features and it could mean that the
        LogViewer for openHAB app won\'t work properly or at all.
        \nThe app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
        \nLink to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app:
        \n - <b>Google Analytics for Firebase</b> (firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)
        \n\nYou should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
        connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don\'t have any of your data
        allowance left.
        \nIf you\'re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
        charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or third party charges.
        \nIn using the app, you\'re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
        turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you\'re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
        \n\nAlong the same lines, I cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can\'t
        turn it on to avail the Service, I cannot accept responsibility.
        \n\nWhen you\'re using the app, it\'s important to bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide
        information to me so that I can make it available to you. I accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        \n\nAt some point, I may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability
        of the app to) may change, and you\'ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. I do not promise that I will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
        works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, I may also wish to stop
        providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
